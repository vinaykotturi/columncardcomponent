## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

  As I continue my learning process I encountered many challenges. This is my second challenge from frontendmentor.io
  I learned new tequinecs during building like display property and manageing margin property. but this is really fun to buil.  



### Continued development

I have faced some layout issues during building I will have to focus on gird system and flexbox layout tequnics on future projects. accessibility is a little bit challenging to me I have to learn about this.
